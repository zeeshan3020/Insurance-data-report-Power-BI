This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to analyze insurance customer data. It helps visualize customer distribution, average charges, and behavioral patterns based on demographic and lifestyle factors.

Objective:

Tools & Skills Used:
- Power BI (Desktop)
- DAX for measures and KPIs
- Slicers for interactivity
- Visuals: Bar chart, Donut chart, Line chart, Ribbon chart
- Data cleaning in Power Query Editor
  
Dashboard Overview:
- Total Customers:1338
- Customer distribution by age group (A1, A2, A3)
- Average charges by age group
- Smoker vs Non-Smoker impact
- Children Count vs Customer Count
- Regional segmentation
